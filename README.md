# Biogotchi!
Biohacking Village 2019 - Biohacking Village Tamagotchi Badge, AKA "Biogotchi"

The Biogotchi is modeled after the original Bandai "Tamagotchi", but centered around raising the realistic organisms of everday microscopic life.

**BioDev**
The Biogotchi badge is flashed with the associated game firmware, but also comes with a USB to UART interface via the microUSB port that interfaces with the onboard Espressif ESP32 WROOM (the brains), making it a fully reprogrammable WiFi and Bluetooth dev board. 

**Rechargeable**
The Biogotchi schematic is modeled after the open source Adafruit ESP32 Feather (which is why we've sourced our batteries and other components from Adafruit, in appreciation!), and include the same LiPo charging capabilities, which means you can recharge your battery by plugging your Biogotchi into a standard USB port.
